    So this is a mum & daughter project.
    Long story short: My mum has discovered her passion for knitting, her speciality: baby & newborn knitting acessories. Let's not dig too much into why she loves knitting and creating acessories for babies (No Mum, you're not gonna be a Grandmother anytime soon ;D) but her creations are too good to not share them with you.
    So there goes the proficient knitting of my mum combined with my super basic programming skills.

    Anyways, for both activities we dedicated lots of our time, love and creativity. The creations are perfectly suitable gifts for all babies and parents who value unique gifts.
    Check it out and contact us.
    
    We're looking forward to getting in contact with you,
    Chantal & Nadine Lee
